# project_red_wine_detection
Nowadays companies are trying to look for faster and alternative solutions to increase their
quality of wine production. And for that they need product experts to upgrade their supply. And
this procedure could be time consuming and expensive. But researchers are now using machine
learning techniques and other statistical methods like PCA, PLS, PLS-DA to predict the quality
of red-wine and other products. So, it is important to analyze the dataset before producing any 
product. In this research we will attempt to use all the above-mentioned techniques to classify 
red wine quality. Conduct data analysis to understand relation between the input variables and the 
dependent variables (output). Also, investigate the outliers and the correlation between the variables to 
observe which variables are correlated and contributing to the dependent variable. And how we can use 
PLS-DA in the machine learning classification.


to run the file unzip the folder and run the balanced_data_analysis file and for the ML file its under  jypter source file wine_qulity_2
and there this a pdf file explaining the analysis and the result.
